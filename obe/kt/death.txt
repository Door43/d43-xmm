====== death, die, dead ======

===== Definition: =====

This term is used to refer to both physical and spiritual death. Physically, it refers to when the physical body of a person stops living. Spiritually, it refers to sinners being separated from a holy God because of their sin.

=== 1. Physical death ===

  * To "die" means to stop living. Death is the end of physical life.
  * A person's spirit leaves his body when he dies.
  * When Adam and Eve sinned, physical death came into the world.

=== 2. Spiritual death ===

  * Spiritual death is the separation of a person from God.
  * Adam died spiritually when he disobeyed God. His relationship with God was broken. He became ashamed and tried to hide from God.
  * Every descendant of Adam is a sinner, and is spiritually dead. God makes us spiritually alive again when we have faith in Jesus Christ.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * To translate this term, it is best to use the everyday, natural word or phrase that refers to death in the target language.
  * In some languages, "to die" may be expressed as "to not live." The term "dead" may be translated as "not alive" or "not having any life" or "not living."
  * Many languages use figurative expressions to describe death, such as "to pass away" in English. However in the Bible it is best to use the most direct term for death that is used in everyday language, unless that would be offensive.
  * In the Bible, physical life and death are often compared to spiritual life and death. It is important in a translation to use the same word or phrase for both physical death and spiritual death.
  * In some languages it may be more clear to say "spiritual death" when the context requires that meaning. Some translators may also feel it is best to say "physical death" in contexts where it is being contrasted to spiritual death.
  * The phrase, "the dead" is a nominal adjective that refers to people who have died. Some languages will translate this as, "dead people" or "people who have died."  (See: nominal adjective)
