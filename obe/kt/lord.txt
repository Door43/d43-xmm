====== lord, master, sir ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "lord" refers to someone who has ownership or authority over other people.

  * This word is sometimes translated as "master" when addressing Jesus or when referring to someone who owns slaves.
  * Some English versions translate this as "sir" in contexts where someone is politely addressing someone of higher status.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * This term should be translated as "master" when it refers to a person who owns slaves. It could also be used by a servant to address the person he works for.
  * When it refers to Jesus, it could be translated as "master" if the context shows it means "religious teacher."
  * If the person addressing Jesus does not know him, "lord" could be translated as "sir." This translation would also be used for other contexts in which a polite form of address to a man is called for.
  * When referring to God the Father or to Jesus, this term is written as "Lord" (capitalized). Make sure the translation clearly distinguishes between "lord" that just means "master" and "Lord" that refers to God.
