====== adultery, adulterous, adulterer, adulteress ======

===== Definition: =====

Adultery is when a married person has sexual relations with someone who is not his spouse. The term "adulterous" describes a person who commits this sin.

  * An "adulterer" is a person who sins by committing adultery. The term "adulteress" is often used to refer specifically to woman who commits adultery.
  * Adultery breaks the promises that a husband and wife made to each other in their covenant of marriage.
  * God commanded the Israelites to not commit adultery.
  * The term "adulterous" is often used in a figurative sense to describe the people of Israel as being unfaithful to God, especially when they worshiped false gods.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * If the target language does not have one word that means "adultery," this term could be translated with a phrase such as, "having sexual relations with someone else's wife."
  * Some languages may have an indirect way of talking about adultery, such as "sleeping with someone else's spouse" or "being unfaithful to one's wife." (See: [[:xmm:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism|euphemism]])
  * When "adulterous" is used in a figurative sense, it is best to translate it literally in order to communicate God's view of his disobedient people as being compared to an unfaithful spouse. If this is not acceptable in the language, the figurative use of this term could possibly be translated as "unfaithful" or "immoral" or "traiterous."
