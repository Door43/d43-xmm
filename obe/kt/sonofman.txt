====== Son of Man, son of man ======

===== Definition: =====

The title, "Son of Man" is best known for how Jesus used it to refer to himself. In the Old Testament, the term "son of man" was also a way of addressing a man.

  * In the Old Testament, the phrase, "son of man" is often used to mean "man" or "human being."
  * God used "son of man" as a form of address, as when he said to the prophet Ezekiel, "â€¦you, son of man, must prophesyâ€¦" This form of address is used throughout the book of Ezekiel.
  * Jesus often used this term to refer to himself instead of saying "I" or "me." It may also have been a modest way of referring to oneself during that time period.
  * The prophet Daniel saw a vision of a "son of man" coming with the clouds, which is a reference to the coming Messiah. Jesus also said that the Son of Man will be coming back someday on the clouds.
  * Many years after that, the apostle John saw a vision of a "son of man" sitting on the clouds.
  * These references to the Son of Man coming, sitting, or riding on the clouds reveal that Jesus is God.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * When Jesus uses the term "Son of Man," other ways to translate it could include, "the One who became a human being" or "the Man from heaven" or "the one who came from heaven."
  * Some translators occasionally include "I" or "me" with this title (as in, "I, the Son of Man") to make it clear that Jesus is talking about himself.
  * Check to make sure that the translation of this term does not give a wrong meaning (such as referring to an illegitimate son or giving the wrong impression that Jesus was only a human being).
  * If the literal translation of this term does not have the correct meaning, when used in a form of address such as, "you, son of man," it could also be translated as, "you, a human being" or "you, man" or "you, a member of mankind."
