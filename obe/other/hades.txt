====== hades, sheol, the grave ======

===== Definition: =====

The terms "hades" and "sheol" are used in the Bible to refer to death and the place where the souls of people go when they die. Their meanings are similar.

  * The term "grave" literally refers to the physical place where a dead body is buried or laid.
  * Sometimes "the grave" is used more generally and figuratively to refer to the condition of being dead.
  * The Hebrew term "sheol" is often used in the Old Testament to refer generally to the place of death. Some English versions translate it as "the grave" or "the pit" or "death." Some keep the word "sheol," spelling it to fit the sound patterns of the language of translation.
  * In the New Testament, the Greek term "hades" refers to a place of torment where those who rebel against God are. This is sometimes contrasted to heaven where those who believe in God are.
  * The term "hades" is coupled with the term "death" in the book of Revelation.
  * At the end times, death and hades will be thrown into the Lake of Fire, which is hell.
