====== heart ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the term “heart” is often used figuratively to refer to a person's thoughts, emotions, desires, or will.

  * Some languages use a different body part such as "stomach" or "liver" to refer to these ideas.
  * Other languages may use one word to express some of these concepts and another word to express others.
  * If a body part does not have this meaning, some languages may need to be more direct and say "thoughts" or "emotions" instead of using the figure of speech.
  * To have a "hard heart" is a common expression that means a person stubbornly refuses to obey God.
  * The expressions "with all my heart" or "with my whole heart" mean to do something with no holding back, with complete commitment and willingness.
  * the idiom, "take it to heart" means to treat something seriously and apply it to one's life.

Translation Suggestions

  * Certain languages may use different body parts to refer to these nonphysical parts of a person.
  * Some languages will prefer to translate "heart" nonfiguratively and say something more directly such as, "thoughts" or "desires."
  * Depending on the context, "with all my heart" or "with my whole heart" could be translated as, "with all my energy" or "with complete dedication" or "completely."
  * The idiom "hard-hearted" could also be translated as, "stubbornly rebellious" or "refusing to obey" or "continually disobeying God."
