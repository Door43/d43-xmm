====== Jeroboam ======


===== Facts: =====

Jeroboam was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel. He ruled over the ten tribes of Israel that rebelled and separated from the southern tribes of Judah and Benjamin.

    * Jeroboam had been one of king Solomon's officials and then he rebelled against the king and caused ten of the tribes of Israel to be divided from the other two tribes.
    * Jeroboam was a very wicked king. He set up idols and encouraged the people of the kingdom of Israel to worship them, instead of worshiping Yahweh at the temple in Jerusalem.
    * Other kings of the kingdom of Israel followed Jeroboam's evil example.
